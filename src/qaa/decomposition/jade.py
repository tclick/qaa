    """Blind separation of real signals with JADE.

    jadeR implements JADE, an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm developed
    by Jean-Francois Cardoso. See http://www.tsi.enst.fr/~cardoso/guidesepsou.html, and
    papers cited at the end of the source file.

    Translated into NumPy from the original Matlab Version 1.8 (May 2005) by Gabriel
    Beckers, http://gbeckers.nl .

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
        a data matrix (n_features, n_samples)
    m : int, default=None
        output matrix B has size mxn so that only m sources are extracted.  This is done
        by restricting the operation of jadeR to the m first principal components.
        Defaults to None, in which case :math:`m = n`.
    verbose : bool
        print info on progress. Default is True.

    Returns
    -------
        array_like
            An m*n matrix B (NumPy matrix type), such that Y=B*X are separated sources
            extracted from the n*T data matrix X. If m is omitted, B is a square n*n
            matrix (as many sources as sensors). The rows of B are ordered such that the
            columns of pinv(B) are in order of decreasing norm; this has the effect that
            the `most energetically significant` components appear first in the rows of
            :math:`Y = B * X`.

    Raises
    -------
    IndexError
        if `m` >= n_features

    Notes
    -----
    Quick notes (more at the end of this file):

    - This code is for REAL-valued signals.  A MATLAB implementation of JADE for both
      real and complex signals is also available from
      http://sig.enst.fr/~cardoso/stuff.html

    - This algorithm differs from the first released implementations of JADE in that it
      has been optimized to deal more efficiently
        1) with real signals (as opposed to complex)
        2) with the case when the ICA model does not necessarily hold.

    - There is a practical limit to the number of independent components that can be
      extracted with this implementation.  Note that the first step of JADE amounts to a
      PCA with dimensionality reduction from `n` to `m` (which defaults to n).  In
      practice m cannot be *very large* (more than 40, 50, 60... depending on available
      memory)

      stuff at http://sig.enst.fr/~cardoso/stuff.html

    # Revision history of MATLAB code:
    #
    # - V1.8, May 2005
    #  - Added some commented code to explain the cumulant computation tricks.
    #  - Added reference to the Neural Comp. paper.
    #
    # -  V1.7, Nov. 16, 2002
    #   - Reverted the mean removal code to an earlier version (not using
    #     repmat) to keep the code octave-compatible.  Now less efficient,
    #     but does not make any significant difference wrt the total
    #     computing cost.
    #   - Remove some cruft (some debugging figures were created.  What
    #     was this stuff doing there???)
    #
    #
    # -  V1.6, Feb. 24, 1997
    #   - Mean removal is better implemented.
    #   - Transposing X before computing the cumulants: small speed-up
    #   - Still more comments to emphasize the relationship to PCA
    #
    # -  V1.5, Dec. 24 1997
    #   - The sign of each row of B is determined by letting the first element be
    #     positive.
    #
    # -  V1.4, Dec. 23 1997
    #   - Minor clean up.
    #   - Added a verbose switch
    #   - Added the sorting of the rows of B in order to fix in some reasonable way the
    #     permutation indetermination.  See note 2) below.
    #
    # -  V1.3, Nov.  2 1997
    #   - Some clean up.  Released in the public domain.
    #
    # -  V1.2, Oct.  5 1997
    #   - Changed random picking of the cumulant matrix used for initialization to a
    #     deterministic choice.  This is not because of a better rationale but to make
    #     the ouput (almost surely) deterministic.
    #   - Rewrote the joint diag. to take more advantage of Matlab"s tricks.
    #   - Created more dummy variables to combat Matlab"s loose memory management.
    #
    # -  V1.1, Oct. 29 1997.
    #    Made the estimation of the cumulant matrices more regular. This also corrects a
    #    buglet...
    #
    # -  V1.0, Sept. 9 1997. Created.

    #  Notes:
    #  ======
    #
    #  Note 1) The original Jade algorithm/code deals with complex signals in Gaussian
    #  noise white and exploits an underlying assumption that the model of independent
    #  components actually holds.  This is a reasonable assumption when dealing with
    #  some narrowband signals.  In this context, one may i) seriously consider dealing
    #  precisely with the noise in the whitening process and ii) expect to use the small
    #  number of significant eigenmatrices to efficiently summarize all the 4th-order
    #  information.  All this is done in the JADE algorithm.
    #
    #  In *this* implementation, we deal with real-valued signals and we do NOT expect
    #  the ICA model to hold exactly.  Therefore, it is pointless to try to deal
    #  precisely with the additive noise and it is very unlikely that the cumulant
    #  tensor can be accurately summarized by its first n eigen-matrices.  Therefore,
    #  we consider the joint diagonalization of the *whole* set of eigen-matrices.
    #  However, in such a case, it is not necessary to compute the eigenmatrices at all
    #  because one may equivalently use `parallel slices" of the cumulant tensor.  This
    #  part (computing the eigen-matrices) of the computation can be saved: it suffices
    #  to jointly diagonalize a set of cumulant matrices.  Also, since we are dealing
    #  with reals signals, it becomes easier to exploit the symmetries of the cumulants
    #  to further reduce the number of matrices to be diagonalized. These
    #  considerations, together with other cheap tricks lead to this version of JADE
    #  which is optimized (again) to deal with real mixtures and to work `outside the
    #  model'.  As the original JADE algorithm, it works by minimizing a `good set' of
    #  cumulants.
    #
    #  Note 2) The rows of the separating matrix B are resorted in such a way that the
    #  columns of the corresponding mixing matrix A=pinv(B) are in decreasing order of
    #  (Euclidian) norm.  This is a simple, `almost canonical" way of fixing the
    #  indetermination of permutation.  It has the effect that the first rows of the
    #  recovered signals (ie the first rows of B*X) correspond to the most energetic
    #  *components*.  Recall however that the source signals in S=B*X have unit
    #  variance.  Therefore, when we say that the observations are unmixed in order of
    #  decreasing energy, this energetic signature is to be found as the norm of the
    #  columns of A=pinv(B) and not as the variances of the separated source signals.
    #
    #  Note 3) In experiments where JADE is run as B=jadeR(X,m) with m varying in range
    #  of values, it is nice to be able to test the stability of the decomposition.  In
    #  order to help in such a test, the rows of B can be sorted as described above. We
    #  have also decided to fix the sign of each row in some arbitrary but fixed way.
    #  The convention is that the first element of each row of B is positive.
    #
    #  Note 4) Contrary to many other ICA algorithms, JADE (or least this version) does
    #  not operate on the data themselves but on a statistic (the full set of 4th order
    #  cumulant). This is represented by the matrix CM below, whose size grows as m^2 x
    #  m^2 where m is the number of sources to be extracted (m could be much smaller
    #  than n).  As a consequence, (this version of) JADE will probably choke on a
    #  `large' number of sources. Here `large' depends mainly on the available memory
    #  and could be something like 40 or so.  One of these days, I will prepare a
    #  version of JADE taking the `data' option rather than the `statistic' option.

    # Notes on translation (GB):
    # =========================
    #
    # Note 1) The function jadeR is a relatively literal translation from the original
    # MATLABcode. I haven't really looked into optimizing it for NumPy. If you have any
    # time to look at this and good ideas, let me know.
    #
    # Note 2) A test module that compares NumPy output with Octave (MATLAB
    # clone) output of the original MATLAB script is available
